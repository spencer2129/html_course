        <h1>Hi, I am Spencer Aranda</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>I am just learning HTML/CSS and I'm loving it!  I have always wanted to learn web developer and build stuff, especially a personal website, and eventually even create a few games that I can add to my site! It has taken me a while to actually commit to learning these things, but it is better late than never, right? I hope to became proficient at it. Aside from my passion for web development, I love playing Dota2 on my new Lenovo Legion PC!  Dota is a lot of fun and you play with lots of people online, and so it gets me very very competitive.  Wish  me luck!</p>
